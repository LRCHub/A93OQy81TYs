Well you done done me
and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill
but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
and now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
Nothing's going to
stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
to win some or learn some
but I won't hesitate
no more no more
It cannot wait I'm yours
Well open up your mind
and see like me
Open up your plans
and damn you're free
Look into your heart
and you'll find
love love love love
Listen to the music of the
moment people
and dancing with us
one big family
It's your God forsaken
right to be loved love
loved love loved
So I won't hesitate
no more no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate I'm yours
I've been spending way
too long checking
my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards
just to try to see it clearer
My breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a
new face and laughed
I guess what I'm a saying
is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity
and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue but
I won't hesitate
no more no more
It cannot wait I'm your
open up your mind
and see like me
Open up your plans
and damn you're free
Look into your heart
and you'll find
the sky is your so free
don't frees don't frees don't
there No need to complicate
cause Our time is short
this so this so this is afraid
I'm yours
